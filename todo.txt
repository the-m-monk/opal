Add argon2id pepper
perform dummy argon2id check even if user is invalid
switch to yaml or similar instead of custom .env-like config

the user creation utility does not check to see if a user under that name already exists which creates a duplicate user entry,
however this duplicate use entry has no actual effect on the server as server will default to using the first entry

downloads: GET /Items/{item uuid}/Download?api_key={access token} (serve file as usual)

add server id generation

replace user auth mutex with rwmutex

clean up argon2id code, replace result with err instead of string

clean and merge jfstructs duplicates

capture json for movie and tvshow

fix metadata image fetcher to pick the same images as jellyfin
metadata image fetcher has had its sorting logic gutted, picks okay images
jellyfin might use omdb for some of its images alongside tmdb

properly cache library namecards instead of always rerendering on server statrtup

fetching metadata takes a while with png encoder, maybe using jpegs was fine and there was just an issue with the encoder or something
metadata image cache misses cause significant image serving latency due to decoding/encoding

namecards dont render vertically centered, potentially due to font

cache ffprobe results, jellyfin 22ms vs Opal 44ms

add multilingual support; add config option to set language and use it to switch title, name, plot, tagline, image selection, etc. in librarymgmt.initMetadata

the video track selector displays "(video track width)p" instead of actual resolution

rating selector system fails often

memory usage while direct playing a video exceeds jellyfin's memory usage under the same conditions

dont create a new json encoder for every endpoint, use json marshal

w.Header().Set("Content-Type", "application/json")
data, err := json.Marshal(res)
if err != nil {
    // handle error
    return
}
w.Write(data)

android client works fine when using web player but breaks when using external player or ExoPlayer.
