/*
The library tree is a global tree that stores all library information alongside associated metadata,
Each Node on the tree is either a directory, a tvshow, or a movie.
The metadata subsystem handles the building of the library tree because:
	1. It already has to fully scan all libraries, may as well reuse the results of the scan
	2. It already monitors changes in libraries to automatically update metadata
	3. Inserting the metadata into the tree as each file and directory is being parsed is easier than inserting it after the fact
